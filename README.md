# OASISv1.0.1 - A Decentralized p2p Chat App

OASISv1.0.1 is a lightweight decentralized chat application inspired by the retro look of Windows 98. This application enables users to generate unique user IDs for anonymous and private communication with peers. The app ensures complete control over user privacy by not storing any user data on servers. Each session requires a new user ID, and all communications are encrypted using [SeaBlockJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seablockjs).

## Features

- **Full Anonymity:** No personal data required, and no information is stored on any servers.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** Direct communication between peers without intermediaries.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages are encrypted, ensuring private conversations.
- **Custom User IDs:** Generate a unique user ID for each session.
- **No Censorship:** Chat freely without the fear of censorship.
